Text Formatting Task: Album Data to HTML

**Goal:** Transform raw, pasted album text (Artist, Title, Metadata, Tracklist) into a structured HTML block using only `<p>`, `<br>`, `<b>`, and `<u>` tags.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1.  **Identify the Album Header:**
    * Take the very first line of the pasted text (the Artist and Album Title).
    * Wrap this line with the following tags, in this order: `<p><b><u>...</u></b></p>`.

2.  **Format the Metadata Block:**
    * Identify the block of text immediately following the header, starting with "Label:" and ending with "Style:".
    * Wrap this entire block in a single set of paragraph tags: `<p>...</p>`.
    * Inside this paragraph, replace **every line break** with the HTML line break tag: `<br>`.
    * *Special Requirement:* Replace the colon and space (`: `) after each label (e.g., "Label:", "Format:") with a non-breaking space and an ampersand (`:&nbsp;`) to ensure consistent spacing. Also, ensure the ampersand symbol (`&`) in the text is HTML-encoded (`&amp;`).

3.  **Identify the Tracklist Header:**
    * Find the line that says "**Tracklist**".
    * Wrap this line with the following tags, identical to the main header: `<p><b><u>Tracklist</u></b></p>`.

4.  **Structure the Tracklist Body:**
    * Identify all lines following the Tracklist header (the Position, Title, and Duration data).
    * Wrap this entire final block of track data in a single set of paragraph tags: `<p>...</p>`.
    * Inside this paragraph, replace **every line break** with the HTML line break tag: `<br>`.
    * Ensure any internal spacing (tabs or multiple spaces used for alignment) is preserved.
