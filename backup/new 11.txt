What we can do in Canvas

Canvas is a collaborative editor where we can work side-by-side. Instead of just talking in the chat, we can build, edit, and preview actual files here.

1. Coding & Software Development

I can write, debug, and explain code in many languages. You can edit the code directly, and I can update it based on your feedback.

Web Apps: React, Angular, and HTML/CSS/JS (Single-file applications).

Scripts: Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, and more.

Data Science: Python scripts for analysis or visualization.

2. Interactive Previews

For web-based code, you can click the "Preview" button to run the code instantly.

Games: Snake, Pong, Chess, or custom logic games.

Tools: Calculators, To-Do lists, Timers, or Budget trackers.

Visualizations: Interactive charts and dashboards.

3. Writing & Content Creation

Canvas is perfect for long-form writing because it keeps formatting clean and allows for easy revisions.

Documents: Blog posts, essays, stories, and reports.

Technical Writing: README files, documentation, and tutorials.

Resumes: I can generate professional resumes using LaTeX (which renders as a PDF).

4. Formatting & Layout

Markdown: I can format text with headers, lists, and tables.

LaTeX: I can render complex mathematical formulas and scientific notation (e.g., 

$$E=mc^2$$

).

How to use it

Ask me to create something (e.g., "Write a Python script to scrape a website" or "Make a React app for a breathing exercise").

I'll generate the file in this window.

You can edit it directly if you want to make small tweaks.

Ask for changes in the chat (e.g., "Make the background blue" or "Fix the bug in line 10"), and I'll update the file for you.
